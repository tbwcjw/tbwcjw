# Monetization Schmonetization
I've been experimenting with displaying ads on the faucet and found that a popup overlay works best. It's unobtrusive, doesn’t impact performance, and closes with a single click. Simple and effective. I'd love to hear your feedback!

In the future, I plan to implement an ad-free experience for users who have donated. This will apply retroactively—anyone who donated before the system is in place will also be exempt from ads.

Just to be clear, this isn’t about making money—it's simply a way to offset hosting costs and the time invested in maintaining the faucet.

# Updates to the Terms And Conditions
The Terms and Conditions for the use of the faucet have been updated to include an "Advertisments" section. The Terms and Conditions can be found [here](https://faucet.tbwcjw.online/terms.html).

# Upcoming events
February 16th, 2025, marks the faucet’s one-month anniversary! To celebrate, for 24 hours on the 16th, the faucet will give away 1 DUCO every 12 hours. Don’t miss it!

See you there,
