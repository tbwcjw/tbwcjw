# The slow opening
Today we deployed [tbwcjw faucet](https://faucet.tbwcjw.online) for the first time! You can recieve 0.5 DUCO every 12 hours! 
We also launched our [discord server](https://discord.gg/Yw9WX49vzg). Join to keep up to date with what's what with the faucet and other projects.

# The plan
As our faucet grows we hope we can reach a point where we are financially viable. As of now, all operations and hosting costs are covered by me, myself and I.
I'm not looking to make money here, just enough to make the faucet sustain itself.
Our current hosting plan is quite limited, but over time with the help of [donations](https://explorer.duinocoin.com/?search=tbwcjw) I hope we can expand.
Donors will recieve a mention on the frontpage, and recieve a role on the Discord server.
In the next few months I'll be tweaking and optimizing the faucet for efficiency and overall performance. It's not strictly in the plans that I integrate
AdSense into the faucet, but should needs be, needs must.
When it's sustainable, I'll tweak the amount of DUCO per use, and maybe even the cooldown time. On holidays (Christmas, New Years, etc) we may give more DUCO with less cooldown time. I'll also make some nice holiday themed themes.

Thanks,
tbwcjw.
