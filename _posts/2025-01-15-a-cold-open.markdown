# A cold open
Today we deployed [tbwcjw faucet](https://faucet.tbwcjw.online) for the first time! You can recieve 0.5 DUCO every 12 hours! 
We also launched our [discord server](https://discord.gg/Yw9WX49vzg). Join to keep up to date with what's what with the faucet and other projects.

Donors will recieve a mention on the frontpage, and recieve a role on the Discord server.
In the next few months I'll be tweaking and optimizing the faucet for efficiency and overall performance. It's not strictly in the plans that I integrate AdSense into the faucet, but should needs be, needs must.
On holidays (Christmas, New Years, etc) we may give more DUCO with less cooldown time. I'll also make some nice holiday themed themes.

Thanks,
tbwcjw.
