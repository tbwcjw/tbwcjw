Since yesterdays outage, I have pushed a health monitor for [faucet.tbwcjw.online](https://faucet.tbwcjw.online) using [Upptime Monitor](https://upptime.js.org/). Upptime monitor will alert me to outages within 5~ minutes of their occurance. It will also help me to track and triage downtime. I have also changed the badge on the front page of tbwcjw.online to display the uptime percentage.

Check it out at [health.tbwcjw.online](https://health.tbwcjw.online).

Thanks,
